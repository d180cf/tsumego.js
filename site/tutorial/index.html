    <h4>Adding stones</h4>
    <p>Use B+Click (i.e. press and hold the "B" key, click the left mouse button and release the "B" key) to add a black stone, W+Click to add a white stone and T+Click to select the target that needs to be captured or needs to live. Let's use <a href="http://www.goproblems.com/945">goproblems.com/945</a> as an example.

    <p>Note, that if the image on the right doesn't appear, it's likely that your browser doesn't support SVG and thus you won't be able to use this solver as it uses SVG to render the go board.
    <p>Use Ctrl+Click to select a stone, then press Del to remove it. Multiple stones can be selected at once. There is also a trick to select a range of cells quickly: press and hold Ctrl, press and hold the left mouse button, move the mouse to another cell, release the mouse button and release Ctrl - a recntagle of cells will be selected. This is useful to clear the entire board.
    <p>Clicking anywhere on the board with no keys held clears the current selection.

    <h4>Fixing holes in the surrounding wall</h4>
    <p>In a typical tsumego the group of stones in question is surrounded by stones of the opposite colors. The surronding stones form something like a dense net: there are holes in the net, but it's also clear that the group cannot escape.

    <p>An advanced tsumego solver could see this too, but this solver is fairly simple and needs a fixed size area to work. This is why all the holes (including diagonal connections) need to be filled beforehand.
    <p>In most cases a hole in the wall simply means that the group inside has one more outer liberty, but that liberty doesn't allow it to escape and also playing on that liberty doesn't help. There are exceptions, of course, but those exceptions are likely to be in very advanced tsumegos that are beyond the capability of this solver. Thus, when fixing the wall in such cases, leave that liberty for the inner group - it may make a big impact on the solution. Also note how I blocked the upper left corner: placing a stone closer to the black group would make things simpler for the solver, but since I'm not sure if playing the hane (the little triangle) matters in this problem, I left two spaces for that hane. Also note, that leaving one space could make a difference too, because then the hane would be in atari and could be captured right away.
    <p>In our example the inner area has 12 empty cells, 1 white stone and 6 black stones that are different from the target block (the two stones marked with a cross). When solving this problem some of these black stones may be captured, increasing the number of possible moves. This is why the size of the area is 12 + 1 + 6 = 19 here. This is in fact close to the practical capability of the solver. The time to find the solution grows exponentially in general, and leaving just one more empty cell may easily double or triple the time taken by the solver; and vice versa, removing just one unnecessary move can make the solver a lot faster. This is why if there are some clearly pointless empty cells inside (most of bamboo joints, certain eye shapes), they should be filled too: this won't affect the solution, but will make the solver a lot faster. This is because the solver doesn't understand the general meaning of moves and doesn't see that some of them cannot possibly help - it will play out all sorts of useless moves before it comes to a conslusion that a solution is found.
    <h4>Inverting the colors</h4>
    The group being captured should be white. This is simply because the solver was originally coded up with that assumption and I haven't fixed this yet. Flipping the colors can be done with one button.

    <p>Now it's time to choose who plays first (black in this case) and click the "Solve" button. Once the solver plays out the best move, you can answer it and click "Solve" again: this time most of intermediate positions are cached and the next move will be shown instantly. However if you reload the page, the cache will be gone and the solution will need to be found again.
        <p>The solver works best in Chrome.
