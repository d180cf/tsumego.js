This is an interactive console solver: it implements a REPL interface for the tsumego library. Usage:

```
tsc
node tgs ../problems/goproblems.com/18629.sgf
```

Perhaps the main feature of the solver is that it can be paused and resumed at any moment. This is possible because the solver is implemented as a es6 generator.
